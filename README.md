##An OSM Blog. Currently in test-phase.

###Installation

This site was built using Jekyll, a static site generator (Intro to Jekyll video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7NBEFmA7yA)

This is an existing Grunt project (http://gruntjs.com/getting-started). 
Assuming that the Grunt CLI has been installed and that the project has already been configured with a package.json and a Gruntfile, it's very easy to start working with Grunt:

1. Navigate to the project's root directory.
2. Install project dependencies with 'npm install' command.
3. run Grunt with 'grunt' command.
4. run 'bundle install' to get required gems

-The Grunt file does many optimization functions and builds the Jekyll site

Deploying Jekyll site to GitHub Pages (http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/)
-This involves changing the baseurl name in the _config file
