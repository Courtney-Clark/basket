OpenStreetMap Basket features a collection of case studies and lessons learned from government, multilateral and non-profit institutions who use and contribute to OSM in their official line of work. We invite you to take a look or submit a case study of your own, and we hope youâ€™ll learn something from our experiences using OSM to shape policy and strengthen field projects. 

Basket is maintained by the OSM Institutions community of practice, whose members include {% for author in site.data.authors %}"{{ author.name }}"{% if forloop.last == false %}, {% else %} and {% endif %}{% endfor %}.
